# Fine Tune BERT for Text Classification with TensorFlow
This project involves fine-tuning a pre-trained BERT model for text classification using TensorFlow. The primary goal is to classify whether questions are sincere or insincere based on the Quora Insincere Questions Dataset. This hands-on project is divided into several tasks that guide you through setting up your environment, processing data, and training the model.
Project Tasks

Task 2: Setup your TensorFlow and Colab Runtime
Instructions to set up TensorFlow and Google Colab environment.
Installing necessary libraries and dependencies.
Task 3: Load the Quora Insincere Questions Dataset
Downloading and loading the Quora Insincere Questions Dataset.
Understanding the dataset structure and features.
Task 4: Create tf.data.Datasets for Training and Evaluation
Converting the dataset into TensorFlow's tf.data.Dataset format.
Splitting the dataset into training and evaluation sets.
Task 5: Download a Pre-trained BERT Model from TensorFlow Hub
Accessing TensorFlow Hub to download a pre-trained BERT model.
